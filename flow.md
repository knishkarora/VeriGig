# Execution Flow Map (flow.md)

## 1. Entry Point
* **Browser Navigation:** `index.html` -> `src/main.tsx` -> `src/App.tsx` (wrapped in `<BrowserRouter>` and `<MarketplaceProvider>`).
* **Route Resolution:** Resolves URLs to corresponding pages:
  - `/`: `LandingPage`
  - `/auth`: `AuthPage`
  - `/app/student/*`: Student pages (`StudentDashboard`, `GigExplore`, `GigDetails`, `StudentWorkspace`, `StudentProfile`)
  - `/app/employer/*`: Employer pages (`EmployerDashboard`, `PostGigWizard`, `GigApplicants`, `EmployerWorkspace`)
  - `/app/admin/*`: Admin pages (`AdminVerifications`, `AdminDisputes`, `AdminAnalytics`)

## 2. Dynamic Execution Sequence & State Flow
```
User Action (e.g. Post Gig / Apply / Submit Deliverable / Approve)
  │
  ▼
Component Handler (e.g. PostGigWizard.handleSubmit)
  │
  ▼
MarketplaceContext Action Dispatcher
  │
  ├─> Updates React State (`gigs`, `proposals`, `verifications`, `notifications`)
  ├─> Triggers Notification dispatch (simulated webhook toast/drawer)
  └─> Updates LocalStorage cache for session persistence
  │
  ▼
Re-render across subscribed modules:
  ├─> Student Explorer (`/app/student/explore`) immediately lists newly published gigs
  ├─> Employer ATS (`/app/employer/gig/:id/applicants`) immediately lists new applicant proposals
  ├─> Workspaces (`/app/student/workspace/:id` & `/app/employer/workspace/:id`) sync milestone statuses
  └─> Admin Queue (`/app/admin/verifications`) reflects approved student IDs with updated trust badges
```

## 3. Modified Scope (Current Phase)
* Scaffolding entire `/frontend` module with all 13 core views, shared components, seed data, and context state provider.

## 4. Cross-Boundary Analysis
* **Role Boundary:** Role switcher updates `currentRole` in `MarketplaceContext`, seamlessly reconfiguring Navbar links, quick actions, and route accessibility.
* **Milestone State Transitions:**
  - `locked` -> `active` (upon hiring & funding escrow)
  - `active` -> `under_review` (upon student deliverable submission)
  - `under_review` -> `completed` (upon employer sign-off & release) OR `in_revision` (upon revision request)
* **Trust Propagation:** Admin verification triggers immediate badge upgrade (`isVerified: true`), showing emerald verified badge across proposals, profiles, and listings.
